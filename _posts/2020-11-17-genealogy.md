As Erna Brodber reminds us, “Bloodlines are dear to everyone.”[^1] My interest in genealogy stems from my current book project, a study of Caribbean family sagas – or perhaps the reverse is true. Perhaps I began thinking about family sagas because I am, as it would seem a lot of people are, obsessed with the “begat” trope, as old as the Book of Genesis and probably older, which explains people’s existence by reference to other people and creates webs of diachronic and synchronic (af)filiation. The ubiquity of this fascination is richly evidenced by the persistent popularity of genealogical research and genetic testing as both personal project (investigating one’s own heritage) and spectator sport (watching this process play out for others in everything from YouTube videos to television series on PBS and the BBC). And of course, genealogy can be instrumentalized, sometimes to pernicious effect – from Rachel Manley’s reference to the black ancestor who supplied “in the world of Caribbean politics, the family’s legitimizing genetic credential,”[^2] to the ADOS movement currently dividing the US-based black population by advocating that reparations be reserved only for those who can prove descendancy from a person enslaved in the United States.[^3]

Obviously, this is not a peculiarly Caribbean phenomenon, yet it arguably acquires a particular shape and force in the Caribbean context. Kamau Brathwaite’s 1996 essay “Note(s) on Caribbean Cosmology” – among its many affordances – demonstrates that some portion, at least, of the contemporary Caribbean’s intellectual and cultural project can be broadly described as a search for origins. That is, we spend a lot of time trying to trace and explain who we are. Collectively, culturally. So Brathwaite spends a lot of time in this essay naming current Caribbean cultural phenomena and explaining them with reference to their roots. He also voices (or perhaps ventriloquizes) in that essay a simultaneous desire for and anxiety about individual genealogical knowledge: “while I struggle in my family to discern a clear line of four or five generations, my ChineseJamaica [*sic*] friend calmly says that he traces back 500 generations – so you can see the kind of arithmetic his culture has to do – and does!”[^4]

As at least one of the artifacts below reveals, personal genealogical information is not necessarily more readily available to Chinese Caribbean people than to others in the region. My point here is rather that Brathwaite enshrines a call for knowledge of one’s personal ancestry within a broader essay on the collective cultural ancestry of the Caribbean, reminding us that these endeavors (the individual and the collective) are intertwined and mutually co-constituting – and, it should be said, similarly fraught. A central question my book asks is: What traces do Caribbean family sagas bear of their emergence from a collision zone between the obsession with origins and the gaps, erasures and distortions of Caribbean history? It seems to me that the digital artifacts gathered here also reward this kind of interrogation.

Genealogy is fraught in the Caribbean context because of the region’s originary catastrophes and displacements: colonialism, the genocide of indigenous people, the enslavement of Africans and indenture of Asians. All created ruptures – some more absolute than others – in connection, kinship webs, knowledge of ancestry: the founts that feed genealogical practice. These ruptures are further exacerbated by plantation logics; there are multiple factors at work here, but these stand out: i) record-keeping practices predicated on treating people as no more than units of labour; ii) misnaming and renaming practices;[^5] iii) patterns of sexual and reproductive exploitation. The record-keeping improves at various points (different points in the very distinct historical trajectories of the different countries and territories) so that it can better track the family histories of a broader set of Caribbean peoples. But, as Dionne Brand powerfully conveys in _A Map to the Door of No Return_, the original displacements persist, arguably haunting all genealogical projects in one way or another.[^6] What does genealogy mean in a region where entire populations of enslaved people were never recorded by name in written documents, where genealogical records are sparse for much of the population even after that point, where the complex and dynamic practices that create families and kinship networks are (or were until very recently) pathologized far more often than they are respected, investigated and documented?

In academia we speak often about literary and intellectual genealogies: how specific ideas or pieces of work are indebted to the thought or work that preceded them. The collection I have assembled here explicitly sidesteps that usage to focus on the more quotidian understanding of the word: the practice by which an individual’s ancestry and kinship are traced, and the body of information resulting from that process. My intention is that these links should help us think about the work that genealogy gets asked to do in the Caribbean and in Caribbean studies, the personal, professional and institutional purposes that it is called upon to serve, and the conditions under which it labours – conditions, as I note above, produced by the historical processes that are themselves the origin story of the contemporary Caribbean. The traces of these conditions can be observed throughout the following collection in the recurrence of three motifs: i) the intersection of personal genealogical interests with collective and national(ist) projects; ii) genealogy figured as antidote to a perceived lack or absence; and iii) the deployment of speculation and improvisation as strategies for redressing archival insufficiency.
