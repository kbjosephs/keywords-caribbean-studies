<h4>Introduction</h4>

Spirituality in the Caribbean has always been a fluid signifier, whose multiple meanings reflect accurately the many sources from which are drawn our plural culture(s). The items I have chosen below reflect not only this plurality, but also Caribbean spirituality’s defiance of easy definition and resistance to domination. Even with the pervasiveness of Christianity in the region, Caribbean spirituality has always evaded empiricism, reflecting, in all its permutations, an epistemology that is not only anticolonial but resistant to such a concept as a homogenous nation-state.

The syncretism of Caribbean spirituality reflects, to borrow from C. L. R. James, “an inherent antagonism between the consciousness of the black masses and the reality of their lives”(_The Black Jacobins_ 407). These practices exercise, indeed, an Africa that we have long been taught to despise, but which forms the backbone of a culture that sustains and defines us, even as itis the source of deep anxiety surrounding the question of “civilisation.” As such, questions of spirituality in the Caribbean are questions of power; it is less about what these beliefs and practices are, than it is about how they function. Many of these beliefs and practices have been or remain illegal (or “seditious”) and are performed in opposition to the colonial state. Despite this, they remain integral to Caribbean being and self-determination.

Even with the incorporation of Hinduism and Islam from indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean spirituality, like the African cosmology that undergirds it, takes for granted that the spiritual and the mundane cannot be separated and that our ancestors are present with and within all things, and that death is not necessarily a departure but a transformation. Indeed, the very syncretism of Caribbean religion reflects a unity that, to its credit, is constantly negotiated and negotiable, one that does not disavow but is defined by difference. This commitment to the spiritual –there are few atheists in the Caribbean –indeed sustained us throughout our kidnap and colonisation, and shielded us from total annihilation by the ‘rational’ materialism of our colonisers. It is through the spirit that the dispossessed can be repossessed, and that we can continue to navigate modernity and its aftershocks.

I hope to contribute to an appreciation of spirituality in the Caribbean as a strategy of survival, resistance and sustenance in the wake of the plantation. Enslaved Africans and indentured ‘Asians’ interpreted and navigated the new worlds they created outof the totality of their domination, and the materials I have curated below converge on an understanding of spirituality as liberation, and of the ‘spiritual’ as immanent in all things.

**Title:** [*The Holy Piby*](https://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/piby/index.htm)  
**Author:** Robert Athlyi Rogers  
**Steward:** [Sacred Texts](https://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm)  

**Description:** The Holy Piby, often referred to as ‘The Black Man’s Bible,’ was published in The United States, South Africa and Jamaica in 1924, and written between 1913 and 1917 by Anguillan Robert Athlyi Rogers (6 May, 1891 –24 August, 1931). In it, Rogers outlined the tenets of the religion of which he was shepherd, the ‘Afro-Athlican Constructive Gaathly.’ The Holy Pibyappears to be originally conceived of as an evolving text, ‘a book founded by the Holy Spirit to deliver the gospel commanded by the Almighty God for the full salvation of Ethiopia’s posterities’ –‘Ethiopia’ here being a general term for Africa. ThePibyis an Afrocentric response to the Euro-Christian Bible, and in it Rogers claims Ethiopia as the ‘Promised Land’ for Black people in the diaspora. As such, it istoday considered one of the foundational texts of the Rastafari movement, heavily influenced by Marcus Garvey’s Back to Africa movement and message, and the growing trend towards Ethiopianism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

**Title:** [Special issue of _Jamaica Journal_ on Jamaican Folk Religion](https://dloc.com/UF00090030/00006/1j?search=jamaica+%3djournal)  
**Editor:** Alex Gradussov  
**Steward:** [Digital Library of the Caribbean](https://www.dloc.com/)

**Description:** This June 1969 edition of the Jamaica Journalwas a special issue on ‘folk’ religious practices in that country. It featured the Edward Seaga’sground-breaking ethnography, by Edward Seaga, ‘Revival Cults in Jamaica;’ an article by Olive Lewin on ‘cult music;’ and Rex Nettleford’s ‘Pocomania in Dance-Theatre.’ These articles reflect a growing academic interest in Afro-syncretic spirituality in the West Indies, as well as historical revision of the role of this spirituality in resistance to slavery. This revisionism is reflected in Mary Reckford’s overview of the 1831 Baptist Rebellion, as well as editor Alex Gradussov’s interview with and reflection on Mallica ‘Kapo’ Reynolds, Jamaican religious leader and folk artist (and advisor to Seaga). Closing the issue is Kenneth Ramchand’s ‘Obeah and the Supernatural in West Indian Literature,’ which outlines how Obeah is explored and exploited in literary fiction
