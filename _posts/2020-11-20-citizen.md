To talk about citizenship in the Caribbean is to talk about an impossibility. As political anthropologist Yarimar Bonilla reminds us, “The majority of Caribbean polities are non-sovereign societies,”[^1] tethered in different ways and to varying degrees to the metropoles that once ruled them. From Martinique’s and Guadeloupe’s status as overseas departments of France, to Puerto Rico’s place in the United States empire, to the English-speaking Caribbean’s incorporation into the Commonwealth, the political configurations of Caribbean islands define them as territories that are both here and there. As “islands scars of the water,”[^2] they are both physically located in the Americas and administratively tied to imperial centers. If we understand citizenship in traditional and somewhat simplified terms as the relationship between people and the state, then non-sovereignty disrupts the primacy of the nation state in this equation and renders citizenship elusive. And yet, what is impossible about citizenship in the Caribbean is also what is generative about it. The region’s terraqueous topographies shape possibilities for migration, political movements, and intellectual exchange that challenge ideas about the insularity of islands.[^3]

The artifacts assembled for this keyword were created by scholars, activists, and artists. Taken together, they illustrate the ways that Caribbean thought and experiences extend, disrupt, and even unravel notions of citizenship. They also show that impossibility is not absence. More than simply “Islands evidence of wounds/Islands crumbs/Islands unformed,”[^4] the Caribbean has always been and remains a site of contestation, kinship, and community formation. These artifacts therefore invite us to go beyond the narrow frame of the juridical and to consider citizenship in all its forms. Whether this means taking seriously the freedom claims made by enslaved people in flight, or charting current struggles for gender and sexual justice in the Caribbean, or foregrounding young people’s voices in civic discourse, these artifacts illuminate the historical, cultural, and artistic dimensions of citizenship.

The artifacts featured here span a range of forms and institutional homes. They are also at varying stages of completion. Some of them are grant-supported digital humanities projects that rely on external funding for their continued survival. Others are digital repositories for well-heeled institutions. And yet others seek to carve out spaces beyond the academy for teaching and researching otherwise. These variations highlight the promises and limits of digital scholarship that is both extensible and ephemeral.

Citizenship as concept and as lived experience can be similarly capacious and fragile. Paying attention to how it operates in the Caribbean requires us to be attuned to forms of community-making that may often fly under the radar of national discourses. If talking about citizenship in the Caribbean is talking about impossibility, it is also creating alternate modes of being in relation. Indeed, it very well may be imagining the world anew.
