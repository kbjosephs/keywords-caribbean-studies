As revolts and abolitionist efforts gained traction in the nineteenth century, European powers turned to _indentures_ as potential replacement plantation labor for enslaved peoples in Caribbean and other colonies. Indentures were expected to work and live in similar conditions as formerly enslaved peoples, and with the same restrictions of movement, but given low wages and the promise of either return fare or allotment of land upon completion of their contracts, which generally lasted between three and ten years. Through deceit, force or choice, hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese people were brought to the Caribbean between 1838 and 1917, with the largest numbers of Indian workers being transported to then British Guiana (approx. 250,000) and Trinidad and Tobago (approx. 150,000), where their descendants now comprise the largest population demographic. Thousands of indentures were also transported to and remained in Jamaica, Grenada, Suriname, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Kitts, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Grenada. Migration inside the region meant that many also migrated to other colonies; Belize was a main destination for former Jamaican indentures, for example. Cuba was the principal destination for Chinese workers (approx. 125,000). Notably, significant numbers of descendants of these workers migrated to the United Kingdom and North America starting in the 1950s.

Scholars, artists, writers, activists and others continue to wrestle with the under-documentation of the history of indentures as well as the legacy of this experience. Studies of indentureship consider how the system worked as a blueprint for contemporary forms of migrant labour (e.g. agricultural and domestic workers schemes), as a structural antecedent for contemporary forms of racialized politics, and in its as expressed in literature and art. Many of these contentions advocate more serious grappling with indentures’ experiences in dominant frameworks theorizing Caribbean culture and history, such as Khal Torabully’s _Coolitude_, which both embraces and works as a corrective addendum to Glissant’s _creolité_ and Césaire’s _négritude_. Additionally, scholars and creatives also turn a critical eye to analysis of patriarchy, homophobia, and racism in diasporic indenture communities.

**Title:** [_Coolitude: Poetics of the Indian Labor Diaspora_](http://www.rajivmohabir.com/coolitude-project)  
**Creator:** Rajiv Mohabir  
**Steward:** [Rajiv Mohabir](http://www.rajivmohabir.com)

**Curatorial Note:** Poet Rajiv Mohabir – who translated the only known literary work by an indenture, _I Even Regret Night: Holi Songs of Demerara_ – leads an elaborate “Coolitude Project” that explores the poetics of the Indian labor diaspora. Through a number of digital projects including interviews, essays and writing prompts, Mohabir engages with the cultural production of writers, artists, musicians, and filmmakers who descend from indentured laborers. “I chart the poetics of Coolitude, itself a queer cousin of Césaire's, Senghor's, and Damas's Négritude,” he explains.

**Curatorial Note:** _Visual Arts After Indenture_ is the first initiative to collect and consider the work of contemporary visual artists whom are descendants of indentured workers, and includes images of work as well as links to artists’ sites. The website also includes information about exhibitions, media and scholarship produced through the project, such as _Wendy Nanan_ at the Art Museum of the Americas—the first one at the institution dedicated to a Caribbean woman—and a companion documentary video available on YouTube.

**Curatorial Note:** Best known for her groundbreaking feminist scholarship, Patricia Mohammed has also produced several creative works, including this experimental video which tells the story of a young Indo-Trinidadian girl who negotiates various cultural demands from familial and social institutions around her. The video centers questions about creolization, nationalism, and diasporic nostalgia.

**Curatorial Note:** In this interview with NPR, _Coolie Woman_ author Gaiutra Bahadur describes her attempt to trace and imagine the history and journey of her indentured great grandmother Sujaria, an indentured worker brought to Guyana in the nineteenth century. The author also explains the meaning and the uses of the word “coolie,” a pejorative name given to indentures that has been reinterpreted by some.

Led by poet-scholar David Dabydeen, the institute is supported by funds from the Gafoor family and is named for the founding publisher and editor of _The Art Journal_, herself a descendant of indentured workers. The institute is also home to the _Journal of Indentureship Studies_ whose first issue will debut in July 2021.
