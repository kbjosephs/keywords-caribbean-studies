As a way into thinking about “capitalism” as a keyword in Caribbean studies, one should perhaps turn from political economy to poetry. For arguably it is the Caribbean’s poets, songsters, essayists, and novelists – as much as its historians (and certainly more than its economists and statisticians) – who have best described and narrated the violent processes and procedures by which capital has made and remade the region. To give but one example, five centuries after Cristóbal Colón stumbled into the archipelago as part of his “Enterprise of the Indies,” Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén wrote of the Caribbean as the “West Indies, Ltd.”[^1] The title poem of Guillén’s 1934 collection, “West Indies, Ltd.” provides us with a legalist appellation cast as poetic critique. With droll elegance, Guillén distills the essence of the fraught history of Caribbean commodification, exploitation, and capitalist incorporation. “West Indies, Ltd” was written during the political and economic tumult of the 1930s, during a period when Wall Street greed and Washington geo-strategy were undermining Cuban sovereignty and contributing to the near-starvation of the Cuban people. Guillén wryly recorded a moment where the transformation of the region into “the grotesque headquarters of _companies and trusts_” was accelerating.[^1] Though of course, in _West Indies, Ltd._, Guillén does more than merely account for the ravishes and displacements of capitalism. His poems also document and celebrate the modes of Black song and Black survival that served as the texts and practices of Caribbean anti-capitalist resistance.

The digital artifacts I have chosen as placeholders for “capitalism” as a keyword of Caribbean studies are inspired by the work of Guillén, as well as many other writers from across the region. Through their literary practices and imaginative representation, they have offered us an implicit methodology for researching and theorizing capitalism in the Caribbean, while generating an unruly, other archive of capitalism itself. Caribbean literature has documented the great historical, social, and political-economic processes through which the Caribbean made capitalism and capitalism remade the Caribbean. This literature has also brought us closer to an understanding of capitalism’s history in the Caribbean, not necessarily as an accumulation of historical facts (though, often times, their detailing and cataloging of capitalism’s ephemera is astounding), but always, as Toni Morrison once wrote, as _truth_.[^2]

While the digital artifacts presented here are not necessarily of a literary bent as such, I would like to suggest that they enable and support the kinds of critical readings and interpretations of capitalism made possible by literature. The artifacts open up the Caribbean past and present to its contingencies and contradictions, to both the blunt brutalities of colonial power and the insidious governmentalities of the post-colonial era. And they do so without sacrificing the style, grace, élan, and beauty by which Caribbean survival has scuffled with “sufferation.”[^3] Conceptually, these artifacts were generated by thinking about three inter-related categories: ecology, labor, and finance. These categories obviously do not exhaust the sprawling archive representing the range of approaches to thinking about capitalism in the Caribbean or in Caribbean studies. I would argue, however, that they are able to capture something of the transhistorical and cross-regional dynamics and transformations of the history of capitalism in the Caribbean over more than five centuries.

Ecology provides a natural beginning. Not only has the geomorphic fact and formation of the archipelago engendered the metaphors through which Caribbean writers have thought and written about Caribbean identity, but the Caribbean’s ecology has been critical to the development of capitalism itself. The geographic location and climatic conditions of the Caribbean have made it both the primordial terrain for commercial expansion as well as a strategic theatre for inter-imperial rivalry and conflict. Both commerce and politics would lead to the “repetitive catastrophes,” as Wilson Harris once dubbed them, of Caribbean space, as the continual search for profit and power would devastate the islands’ primeval ecologies.[^4]

“Sugar exterminated the forests,” historian Manuel Moreno Fraginals wrote of Cuba.[^5] But across the Caribbean, the development and expansion of the market would lay waste to the region’s ancient ecosystems: the old-growth forests of pine, cedar, mahogany, ceiba, and ironwood were clear-cut for sugar, but also for cattle, tobacco, bananas, and other commodities. “Deaf and blind to history, focusing on the present, the sugarocracy destroyed in years what only centuries could replace,” Moreno Fraginals continues, “and at the same time destroyed much of the island’s fertility by soil erosion and the drying-up of thousands of streams.” Both land and water have been assaulted during the incessant, unforgiving expansion of capitalism in the Caribbean. Coast lines and waterways were remade for canals, ports, dykes, and embankments; the sea has been poisoned by caravels and cruise ships; coral reefs have disintegrated and aquatic life decimated; sea levels have risen while tropical storms and hurricanes have intensified as ocean temperatures spike. In short, capitalism has unleashed five hundred years of Caribbean environmental apocalypse.

Of course, it was not an abstract, immaterial capitalism that cleared the forests, harvested the sugar cane, dredged the canals, and impoldered the coasts. Human labor did this work and there can be no accounting for capitalism in the Caribbean without an account of Caribbean labor and the forms of bondage, regulation, and social control it has been subjected to. The history of capitalism in the Caribbean is the history of the Caribbean working classes and peasantries, of the enslaved and the indentured, as they struggle against alienation and exploitation and for dignity, freedom, and autonomy. It is the history of serving tourists and of sex workers.[^6] It is also the history of Caribbean diaspora: of the populating of the islands by Africans and Indians after the near-total annihilation of the indigenous populations, of intra-Caribbean migration to Cuba and Panama, of the journeys to Brooklyn and Brixton, and to Miami and Montreal. Again, literature provides an important archive for these migrations, as demonstrated through the novels of Eric Walrond, Paule Marshall, Austin Clarke, Samuel Selvon, Edwidge Danticat, and others.

The story of labor is also about labor’s antagonists: of the Caribbean middle classes and elites as they assume the seemingly paradoxical positions as both anti-colonial nationalists and transnational compradors – and as they consolidate the fusion of class with color, often while promoting national myths of multiracialism, _mestizaje_ and ethnic mixing, unity in diversity. On the other hand, there are also those who exist on the margins of the official story of labor and are surplus to the productive regimes of capital: hustlers, higglers, idlers, scammers. The permanently unemployed. An Antillean lumpenproletariat who reject incorporation by capitalism and distain the valorization of work as salvation.

Yet if the history of capitalism in the Caribbean is a story of labor, the story of labor is invariably a history of gender: we must consider the doubled experience of labor experienced by Caribbean women. That is, in the history of capital accumulation in the Caribbean, profit was only possible because women have not only worked in the fields and factories, but because they have been responsible for the biological reproduction of the population necessary to expand and continue the work force.[^7] The story of women and women’s bodies in the history of capitalism in the Caribbean remind us that the categories and social functioning of gender, as well as race,[^8] are not merely ancillary byproducts of capitalism’s social relations. They are part of the primordial social orders from which capitalism emerged, providing the necessary conditions for the extraction of surplus value and the possibilities of profit.

The question of finance is arguably the most difficult term to grasp – largely because of its lack of physicality, its abstract and occult forms, and its spectral, placeless, ageographic presence. Certainly, finance remains in the shadow of the more typical keywords or metaphors through which we have understood the history of capitalism in the Caribbean. Finance is less understood than the plantation, that meta-historical, pan-Caribbean complex put forward as a kind of archetypal model and metaphor for Caribbean political economy.[^9] Or of the commodity – sugar, especially – in which the history and social relations of the Caribbean can be interpreted and unraveled.[^10] Or in the physical body of labor itself. Yet it is arguably finance and financialization – of rendering the material into the immaterial for the purposes of exchange and profit – that has provided the ghostly sinews for the expansion of capitalism in the Caribbean. The financing of the first voyages of exploration and conquest, to the birth of the mercantilist era of capitalism and slavery,[^11] to the rise of international banking in the region,[^12] to the era of offshore banking and cryptocurrencies[^13] – all demonstrate the long-term historical and conceptual importance of finance to capitalism in Caribbean. Moreover, from Haiti’s “double debt” of 1823, to Cuba’s “odious debts” of the 1930s, to the IMF debts of the Jamaican 1980s, to the present-day $74 billion “national” debt of Puerto Rico – finance has been critical to the imperial governance and control of the Caribbean. It has provided the means by which Caribbean sovereignty has been repeatedly undermined.

**Title:** [_Online Guide to Early Map Images of the Caribbean_](http://thereedfoundation.org/rism/maps/)  
**Author:** Research Institute for the Study of Man  
**Steward:** [The Reed Foundation](http://www.thereedfoundation.org/rism/)

**Curatorial Note:** Cartography has been central to the production of knowledge about the geography of the Caribbean and to its exploitation. While there are a number of different historical collections of Caribbean maps on the internet, the Research Institute for the Study of Man has compiled them together, creating a wonderful clearinghouse for other map collections while uploading many maps of their own.

**Title:** [_Los ingenios: colección de vistas de los principales ingenios de azúcar de la isla de Cuba las láminas dibujadas del natural y litografiadas por Eduardo Laplante_](http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/bdh0000013976)  
**Creators:** Eduardo Laplante and Justo G. Cantero  
**Steward:** [Biblioteca Digital Hispánica](http://www.bne.es/es/Catalogos/BibliotecaDigitalHispanica/Inicio/index.html)

**Curatorial Note:** With, its twenty-eight stunning lithographic plates by Eduardo Laplante, Justo G. Cantero’s _El Ingenio_ is both a classic document for the study of Cuba’s nineteenth century history, but also a visual archive of the plantation in the greater Caribbean’s history of capitalism.

**Title:** [Digital Library of the Caribbean](https://dloc.com/)  
**Creators:** Multiple  
**Stewards:** [Florida International University](http://www.fiu.edu/), in partnership with the [University of Virgin Islands](http://www.uvi.edu/pub-relations/uvi/home.html), and [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/)

**Curatorial Note:** The importance of the Digital Library of the Caribbean to both the history of capitalism in the Caribbean, and to Caribbean studies in general, cannot be overstated. As a portal to the digital collections of a range of libraries representing the region, it offers a public-facing repository that serves both experts and amateurs interested in Caribbean research, for all aspects of the region, and from any number of disciplinary perspectives. While the dLoc’s collections of oral histories of Caribbean labor are significant, it is also uniquely important as a digital archive of the representation of Caribbean ecologies. Its sub-collections of lithographs, gelatin silver prints, stereographs, postcards, and photographs offer an incredible documentation of Caribbean space, much of it already destroyed by the expansion of capitalism.

**Title:** [_The Caribbean Review of Gender Studies_](https://sta.uwi.edu/crgs/archives.asp)  
**Editors:** Patricia Mohammed and Gabrielle Hosein  
**Steward:** [The University of the West Indies](http://www.sta.uwi.edu/)

**Curatorial Note:** _The Caribbean Review of Gender Studies_ is not specifically devoted to labor, but its commitment to examining gender in all its manifestation and forms in the Caribbean makes it is a critical source for understanding the doubled form of labor, and with it the role and status of Caribbean women, in the accumulation and reproduction of capitalism.

**Title:** [George Padmore Archive](https://www.marxists.org/archive/padmore/index.htm)  
**Creator:** Unknown  
**Steward:** [Marxists Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org)

**Curatorial Note:** The writings of the Trinidadian Pan-Africanist George Padmore provide an incredible window into the global world of colonialism, anti-imperialism, and Black labor in the twentieth century. His 1929 monograph _The Life and Struggles of Negro Toilers_ is a neglected, but unprecedented and unsurpassed, study of Black labor and insurgency in Africa, the United States, and the Caribbean. A growing collection of Padmore’s texts, including _The Life and Struggles_, is available via the Marxist Internet Archive, an incredible repository of texts and journals from the vast historical archive of Marxist thought and radical anti-capitalist movements.

**Title:** [Legacies of British Slave-ownership](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/)  
**Creator:** The Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership  
**Steward:** [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)

**Curatorial Note:** Based in the archival records of the compensation payments distributed to British investors in slavery in the Caribbean and other British territories, the Legacies of British Slave Ownership project documents the pervasiveness and persistence of slavery to modern Britain. The records of the Legacies project serve to verify Eric Williams’ once-controversial claims concerning the importance of slavery to the rise of capitalism while also bolstering the claim for Caribbean reparations.

**Title:** [Puerto Rico Syllabus](https://puertoricosyllabus.com)  
**Creators:** Yarimar Bonilla, Marisol LeBrón, Sarah Molinari, Isabel Guzzardo Tamargo, and Kimberly Roa  
**Steward**: [Unpayable Debt](https://www.socialdifference.columbia.edu/projects-/unpayable-debt-capital-violence-and-the-new-global-economy)

**Curatorial Note:** A smart and sprawling site on Puerto Rico’s culture, society, and history, The Puerto Rico Syllabus contains an incredible set of resources on the origins of the island’s current economic crisis and the attempts by various levels of government to relieve and restructure its $72 billion debt. The Puerto Rico Syllabus is invaluable resource for both academics and activists.

**Title:** [The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/)  
**Editors:** Michael Hudson, Martha M. Hamilton, Gerard Ryle, Marina Walker Guevara, and Tom Stites
**Steward:** [The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists](https://www.icij.org)

**Curatorial Note:** Attempts to investigate the contemporary history of capitalism in the Caribbean are often thwarted by corporate secrecy, private archives, and attorney-client privilege. The Panama Papers has the potential to change this. Based on the leak of more than 11.5 million financial and legal records generated by the Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossak Foneseca, The Panama Papers are a gold mine for researchers. This archive exposes a system that enables financial crime, corruption and wrongdoing, hidden by secretive offshore companies, offering a rare and unprecedented level of access to the shady world of front companies and shell corporations that use the Caribbean as their base.

**Title:** [_West Indies LTD._](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/west-indies-ltd-1934--1/html/ff57fb10-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064.html)  
**Author:** Nicolás Guillén  
**Steward:** [Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/)

**Curatorial Note:** In _West Indies, Ltd._, Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén poetically documents the cultural and political upheavals American capitalism brought to the Caribbean in the 1930s, and the forms of Black song that provided the soundtrack to Caribbean anti-capitalist resistance
